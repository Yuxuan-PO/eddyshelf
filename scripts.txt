%%%%%%%%%% FOLDER STRUCTURE %%%%%%%%%%%%%

- oldeddy\ - old vertical gaussian profile eddy
	- proximity - essentially topoeddy
	- sbeddy - front + eddy simulations
	- 
- sbreak - shelfbreak front tests
- solideddytest - test out solid body profile
- wind   - testing wind driven bg flow
- zhangeddy - testing out Zhang profile.

New Zhang eddy
- topoeddy
	- 

%%%%%%%%%%
track_eddy.m - implementing chelton et al. (2011) method

bathy_crooked.m, bathy2.m - these are both scripts that create fancy shaped bathymetry
bathy_simple.m - creates simple sloping bathymetry

modify_dye.m - script that resets dye concentration in a ROMS restart file
roms_create.m - create all .nc files required for ROMS run (forward model)

images.m - creates images
movies.m - creates nice looking movies for presentation

eddy_obuko.m - obuko-weiss diagnostic based tracking

ltrans_read.m - reads LTRANS netcdf output
tracmass_read.m - reads TRACMASS output

%%%%%%%% ANALYSIS %%%%%%%%%

analyze_topoeddy - analyzes eddy on beta plane with topography
calc_nondim		 - calculates needed non-dimensional parameters
diagnostics		 - lots of code for diagnostic plots

compare_floats   - compare float moments for LTRANS and ROMS
compare_ew		 - analyze E-W isobath runs with & without mean flow

%%%%%%%%% FILES %%%%%%%%%%%%

eddytrack.mat 	 - eddy track from track_eddy.m
nondim.mat		 - stores nondim params from calc_nondim.m
